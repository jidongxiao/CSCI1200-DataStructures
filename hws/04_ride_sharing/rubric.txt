   - Two or more of name, collaborators, or hours not filled in (-2)
 - OVERALL CLASS DECLARATION & IMPLEMENTATION AND CODING STYLE (Good class design, split into a .h and .cpp file.  Functions > 1 line are in .cpp file.  Organized class implementation and reasonable comments throughout. Correct use of const/const& and of class method const. ) (7 pts)
   - No credit (significantly incomplete implementation) (-7)
   - Function bodies containing more than one statement are placed in the .h file. (-2)
   - Missing include guards in the .h file. (Or does not declare them correctly) (-1)

   - Improper uses or omissions of const and reference. (-1)
   - Overly cramped, excessive whitespace, or poor indentation. (-1)
   - Poor file organization: Puts more than one class in a file (okay for very small helper classes, maybe) (-1)
   - Poor variable names. (-1)
   - Contains useless comments like commented-out code, terminal commands, or silly notes. (-1)
 - DATA REPRESENTATION (Must use std::list for the implementation.) (5 pts)
   - No credit (significantly incomplete implementation). (-5)
   - Does not use std::list. (-5)
